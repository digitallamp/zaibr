It\u2019s fundamental, for many of us, to life as we know it, and it\u2019s a field where \u2013 historically \u2013 it\u2019s been very difficult for computers to out-perform humans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has to do with how the human brain processes visual input, versus how computers perceive it. A computer sees a grid of colours. However, humans DON\u2019T see this. No one could tell you the RGB values of eye-neuron E2. What we see, instead, are lines, contrasts, and such; things that have already involved some processing. (This is where optical illusions come from.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The human brain naturally sorts what we see into meaning. That\u2019s why it\u2019s difficult for humans to reproduce a grid of random colurs, but we could easily recreate a scene that makes sense, drawn in a style we know, such as anime. We don\u2019t actually remember individual elements \u2013 as our human memories actually suck, frankly \u2013 but we remember objects and events that we perceived; i.e. the meaning we made from it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Studies have even shown that this is part of our brains\u2019 structure. They did a study where cats weren\u2019t allowed to see vertical lines. They were raised in a box with their heads fixed, immobile, so they only saw horizontal stripes. Grown up, they had trouble perceiving things that were straight up and down, but they could see it if it was held horizontally. The cats didn\u2019t have vertical perception neurons.<sup>1<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Computers don\u2019t have these neurons either. But, with advances in AI, they may very well soon get them! These days, vision in computers is becoming a reality. Already we have things like self-driving cars that use computer vision to navigate. What\u2019s the next step?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think how much better computers would be than humans at a great variety of tasks. If you ask a person to count the ships in a harbour, they\u2019ll struggle, and probably have to count on their fingers. A computer won\u2019t struggle with counting. Its only struggle will be figuring out what, exactly, is a \u201cship\u201d in the scene.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, with advances in computer vision, this is fast becoming a reality. And then the sky is the limit! (Literally; computer-powered aircraft and spaceships are <em>already<\/em> a reality!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" \/>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/us\/blog\/brain-food\/201404\/the-cat-nobel-prize-part-ii<\/li><\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Vision is two things.
