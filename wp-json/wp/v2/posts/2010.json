In fact, the IoT in the 2020\u2019s is reality. And it\u2019s helping us out in ways that maybe you haven\u2019t foreseen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, companies are already using the Iot to optimise their business practices to the utmost degree. Such is the case with the Phoenix, Arizona-based company HomeSmart \u2013 which has since gone international. What this company does is, rather than find itself weighted down by paper, or cumbersome \u2013 maybe even electronic \u2013 systems, they use new technology to optimise the business practice itself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>HomeSmart\u2019s technology is called \u201cRealSmart\u201d. What it does is it fills in any potential gaps between agents and real estate brokers, allowing everything to be done in optimal time, without any delay. The moment that a task is completed, the results appear on the other user\u2019s screen. It highlights its operation in \u201creal-time\u201d, with \u201cautomated notifications at every stage of the process.\u201d<sup>1<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is direct utilisation of the theory of the \u201cinternet of things\u201d. At HomeSmart, the \u201cthings\u201d are each minute step of the real estate process, like documents, and the \u201cbrain\u201d that binds it together is the technology behind RealSmart \u2013 which is available online or as an app. The central hub holds the whole process together, ensuring that everything runs smoothly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it\u2019s growing \u2013 hugely. Especially in the wake of the pandemic, which did a number on many businesses in the real estate sector. HomeSmart \u2013 who developed their products based on technology and the IoT \u2013 was barely affected. Now HomeSmart\u2019s platform has a user base of almost 20,000 agents, and is recognised on both the Inc. 5000 list (where it\u2019s been for 8 years) and the Entrepreneur 2020 Fastest-Growing Franchises list.<sup>2<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is just a glimpse of a company that\u2019s focused itself on technology, and done incredibly well as a result, even as movement across the world was restricted and things like open houses became danger zones. By focusing on integrating technology into its process, HomeSmart overcame that. Now it\u2019s an incredibly strong real estate company, poised and ready to surmount whatever next comes its way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the president, Ashley Bowers, said, \u201cHomeSmart has continued to raise the bar for what real estate excellence looks like even in spite of some very serious challenges, and we have no plans of stopping.\u201d<sup>2<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" \/>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/tech.homesmart.com\/\" class=\"broken_link\">https:\/\/tech.homesmart.com\/<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/rismedia.com\/2020\/09\/01\/homesmart-international-surpasses-19000-real-estate-agents\/\" class=\"broken_link\">https:\/\/rismedia.com\/2020\/09\/01\/homesmart-international-surpasses-19000-real-estate-agents\/<\/a><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The so-called \u201cinternet of things\u201d (IoT) \u2013 where every \u201cthing\u201d contains a processor and can communicate with a centralised control \u2013 isn\u2019t at all a new concept.
