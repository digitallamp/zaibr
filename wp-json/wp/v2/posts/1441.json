What\u2019s that got to do with machine learning?\u201d The answer \u2013 which may surprise you \u2013 is quite a bit, actually.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These days, machine learning is the new vision of the future. And it\u2019s making huge strides. Even in fields that may \u2013 initially and to the uninitiated \u2013 not seem like a good \u201cfit\u201d for artificial intelligence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take the real estate sector. Perhaps you might thing, \u201cReal estate? What\u2019s&nbsp;<em>that<\/em>&nbsp;got to do with machine learning?\u201d The answer \u2013 which may surprise you \u2013 is quite a bit, actually.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several reasons for this. AI \u2013 and machine learning \u2013 allow computers to take on some of the tasks that, traditionally, realtors have labured over. For example, recommendations. A successful realtor matches clients with real estate that is ideal for their situations \u2013 and they just can\u2019t pass up. What if a computer could do this? Well, with machine learning, it can! It can take in each client\u2019s criteria, and churn out optimised, individualised recommendations. In 2016, Inman conducted an experiment called \u201cBroker vs. Bot\u201d, which pitted professional realtors against a machine-learning-powered computer. The human real estate journalist picked out the same properties that were suggested by the AI bot.<sup>1<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But recommendations are just one way that machine learning can help out a real estate business. There are others. Clients want 24\/7 access to their realtor; so rather than hiring office workers to work graveyard shifts, why not have an intelligent bot they can talk to?<sup>1<\/sup>&nbsp;And what about the long-term relationships that realtors build with their clients, that help them to sell not just one, but several properties? Machine learning can help here as well \u2013 and already does, through CRM (customer relationship management) systems that monitor agent-client interactions and provide assistence to keep those vital connections strong.<sup>1<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And let\u2019s look elsewhere in the real estate sector. Take the company HomeSmart International \u2013 a global leader in the real estate sector. Why? Because it uses machine-learning-powered technology (called RealSmart) to optimise the interactions between agents, brokers, and buyers. Suddenly documents can be digitally transferred and signed in minutes, rather than waiting days for \u201csnail mail\u201d. An entire business can be run from a laptop. HomeSmart even markets its product as \u201ceverything you need in one place\u201d<sup>2<\/sup>&nbsp;\u2013 and why not? With machine learning, it\u2019s optimised not only the agent\u2019s tasks, but the way that the real estate business itself can be run.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s important \u2013 especially for real estate agents \u2013 to understand that machine learning does not\u00a0<em>replace<\/em>\u00a0humans. Machine learning and AI\u00a0<em>supplement<\/em>, and increase the efficiency of, human-run operations. In the end, the future is clear: real estate companies that embrace machine learning can thrive, and those that fall off the bandwagon are going to flounder.<sup>1<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.inc.com\/james-paine\/3-ways-ai-is-changing-real-estate.html\" class=\"broken_link\">https:\/\/www.inc.com\/james-paine\/3-ways-ai-is-changing-real-estate.html<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/tech.homesmart.com\/\" class=\"broken_link\">https:\/\/tech.homesmart.com\/<\/a><\/li><\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Perhaps you might thing, \u201cReal estate?
